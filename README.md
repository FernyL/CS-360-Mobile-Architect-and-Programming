What user needs was this app designed to address?
The user needs the Inventory app was designed to address were logging into or registering for an account. An inventory screen would also be needed to add items to a list and then either edit or delete the item if necessary. A database was needed to check for or save the username and password to a table. Another table in the database was created for the inventory items so that users may add, edit, or delete an item. An SMS notification function was also created to ask for permission to use SMS messaging and send out an SMS message if an inventory item count was zero.  

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The screens necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app are the login/register, inventory list, add item, and edit item screens. My UI designs were succesful and kept users in mind by being kept simple and organized. The buttons were all labeled so that the user knows what each interactive element does.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
In my approach to coding this app I initially read and understood all the user needs and then I proceeded to develop a prototype consisting of a simple layout of the inventory application. I broke down the tasks into sections and took it one step at a time. I started with the view layouts, then created the databases, and then added functionality to the app. Everything was kep modular, organized, and easy to understand which is also essential for any future projects. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I made sure to test throughout the entire development stage to ensure the application and its functions worked correctly. I did this by running the application on an Android emulator and checking the views and testing the functionality. This process is important because it reveals what the app will actual look like on a device and ensures the app performs as expected.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I had to innovate to overcame a challenge when it came to creating a dynamic list with the recycler view. As this was my first time using android studio and creating an application I did not know where to start and had to search up different resources to help me out. I had to use a custom adapter to implement the dynamic list.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I felt like I was able to my knowledge, skills, and experience when it came to designing the application and keeping the layout, colors, and typography simple and organized so that the user would not be visually overwhelmed with too much going on within each screen. All components were clearly labeled and the color choices complemented one another.
